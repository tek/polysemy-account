# About

This is a Haskell library for [Polysemy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy) that provides effects for
managing accounts with Argon2-hashed password authentication.

Consult the [Haddocks](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy-account/docs/Polysemy-Account.html) for more
documentation.

*Note*: Only the root module, `Polysemy.Account`, adheres to the PVP.
